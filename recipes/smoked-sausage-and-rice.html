        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One pot smoked sausage and rice</p>
        <p>This sausage and rice casserole recipe was conceived as a quick and low-effort dish. What makes this recipe tick 
            is the use of smoked sausages. An under-utilised yet economical ingredient sold at all supermarkets, smoked sausages 
            like kransky and kielbasa (Polish sausages) pack a ton of flavour thanks to their smoky taste and the generous seasoning 
            in the sausage itself.</p>
